// Methods
public void addNewCourse(String courseCode, String section, String instructor, String startTime, String endTime, String day) {
// Add new course to the linked list
}

public void deleteCourse(String courseCode) {
// Delete course from the linked list
}

public void updateCourse(String courseCode, String newCourseCode, String newSection, String newInstructor, String newStartTime, String newEndTime, String newDay) {

public CourseAssignmentInformation(String courseCode, String courseTitle, int credits, String courseType, String parallelCourse, int parallelCourseCredits) {
this.courseCode = courseCode;
this.courseTitle = courseTitle;
this.credits = credits;
this.courseType = courseType;
this.parallelCourse = parallelCourse;
this.parallelCourseCredits = parallelCourseCredits;
}

// Methods
public void addNewCourse(String courseCode, String courseTitle, int credits, String courseType, String parallelCourse, int parallelCourseCredits) {
// Add new course to the linked list
}

public void deleteCourse(String courseCode) {
// Delete course from the linked list
}

public void updateCourse(String courseCode, String newCourseCode, String newCourseTitle, int newCredits, String newCourseType, String newParallelCourse, int newParallelCourseCredits) {
// Update course information in the linked list
}

public void searchCourse(String courseCode) {
// Search for course in the linked list
