# NSU-CSE225-Project

As the term project of CSE225, you are required to develop a C++ application based on Linked List that can be used to allocate the section of different courses to the faculty members based on some business rules. The relevant dataset is attached herewith for your better understanding. 

The business rules are:
1. You cannot assign more than 11 credits to a faculty member.
2. You cannot assign multiple classes in the same slot for a particular faculty member.

You may add other rules as you seem fit.

You are also expected to generate some reports through this application. Some of the examples are given below (but not limited to):
1. Faculty-wise routine
2. Course-wise routine
3. Room-wise routine (may be) and so on

You may start with defining multiple Linked Lists to hold the data of the followings:

1. Faculty Information

2. Course Information

3. Course Assignment Information

Then you must include CRUD operations over these linked lists. CRUD means - 

C for Create new records.

R for Read (Search) Existing records

U for Update existing records

D for Delete existing records.
